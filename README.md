Introduction:
The goal of this project is to apply the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to the make_moons dataset
to identify clusters of data points. DBSCAN is particularly well-suited for this task as it can find arbitrarily shaped clusters and is robust to noise.

Requirements:

To run this project, you need the following libraries:
Python 3.x
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

Results
After running the script, a scatter plot will be displayed, showing the clustering results. Different colors represent different clusters, 
and noise points (if any) are marked as a distinct color.


Conclusion
The DBSCAN algorithm effectively clusters the make_moons dataset, identifying the two crescent-shaped clusters and handling noise points appropriately.
This demonstrates the power of DBSCAN in finding arbitrarily shaped clusters and its robustness to noise.
